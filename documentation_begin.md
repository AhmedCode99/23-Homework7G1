# Equilibrium Configurations for Na<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub> Tetramer Clusters

To determine the equilibrium configurations of Na4Cl4 clusters for tetramers and plot their configurations with energies, we can proceed with the following steps:

1. Define the potential energy function for the Na<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub> cluster.
   For our case the potential energy is of the form:

The potential energy function parameters for the Na4Cl4 cluster are defined as follows:
- $\ A_{ij} = 423.80 \ eV$
- $\ \rho = 0.317 \ Å$
- $\ \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} = 1.44 \ eV·nm$


3. Initialize the cluster geometry to an ideal case.
4. Use an optimization algorithm to minimize the energy and find the equilibrium configuration.
   Note: We will use CG algorithm for the optimization.
6. Plot the equilibrium configurations using scatter plots and label them with their energies.
